# image-to-ascii
i like ascii art but im not too good at it.

## how to use
the program will simply ask the name of the picture you want to use (put the .jpg or .png after). Then, 3 files will be created:
1. grayscale.png (serves no purpose after te program finishes);
2. ascii_light: the ascii for light backgrounds
3. ascii_dark: the ascii for dark background or reversed.
